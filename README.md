Material for the course "Python Programming for Scientists" (Heidelberg University), 
taught by Dylan Nelson. 

Note that this group is **somewhat more advanced**, and will go 
at a faster pace to reach interesting topics at the end. It is recommended for those 
with at least some prior programming experience.

Semesters offered:

* WS 24/25 (Group 4) Feb 17 - Feb 21, 2025 (HÃ¶rsaal of Phil 12, i.e. the old ivy-covered lecture building, Albert-Ueberle-Str. 7)
  * If this room sucks, we will potentially move elsewhere. BRING YOUR OWN LAPTOP.

* WS 22/23 (Group 7) Mar 27 - Mar 31, 2023 (Phil 12 CIP)
  
* SS 22 (Group 8), Sep 26 - Sep 30, 2022 (Phil 12 CIP)
